🚌 kommyut

A Group Research Project based on Sakay.ph integration

📌 Overview

kommyut is a collaborative research and development project built in 4 days.
Inspired by Sakay.ph
, this project replicates and extends features of a public transport route-planning service, with custom enhancements tailored to our research goals.

✨ Key Features

⚡ Modern frontend stack: Built with React + TypeScript + Vite for speed and efficiency.

🛠️ Clean code structure: Includes ESLint and TypeScript configs for maintainability and type safety.

📂 Scalable project setup: Well-organized directories (public/, src/, tsconfig.json, vite.config.js) for future growth.

🗺️ Transport planner functions: Modeled after Sakay.ph’s route search, transit mapping, and schedule lookup capabilities.

🔑 What Makes It Unique

🚀 Rapid prototyping – developed within just 4 days with focused, efficient design decisions.

📖 Research-oriented – not just a clone; explores how to integrate and possibly enhance route-planning systems (e.g. UI/UX, performance, custom data).

🧩 Modular & extensible – designed for easy feature additions such as API integrations, mapping services, or mobile responsiveness.

🔮 Future Roadmap

📡 Add real-time transit data

🗺️ Improve mapping UI/UX (interactive maps, overlays, better navigation flow)

🌍 Expand to multiple cities & transit agencies

📱 Implement offline support & mobile-friendly features
